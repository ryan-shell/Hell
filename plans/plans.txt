Before you write any code, you need to come up with a plan. Be prepared to answer the following questions:

How are you storing the word or phrase selection? How are you storing its hint?

The words will be stored in a list as well as the categories and their hints

How are you managing each player's turn?

a players turn will be managed by a variable that is reset at the start of each round

How are you maintaining each player's bank?

There will be two banks the players total bank and the round bank each stored in a list with a specific index for each players total.


What does the logic look like for managing a round?

there will be a loop that will end once the puzzle is solved.

    spin the wheel and guess consonant
        option to buy a vowel after spinning wheel

        buy a vowel for 250
    Attempt to solve puzzle


What does the logic look like for buying a vowel?

    after spinning the wheel and guessing consonant they will have option to buy vowel
    if they dont then there turn ends
    and it advances to next player

How are you running the game overall?

    there will be a loop for the round overall which will keep track of when the round ends
    these may get broken up into different functions depending on exactly what is happening
